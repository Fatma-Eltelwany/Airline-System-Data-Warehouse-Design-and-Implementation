We choose Galaxy star schema because we have more than one fact table (four business processes)
and we choose the granularity for each business process to be atomic
so each individual row in the fact table represents the lowest level of details for example

in flight activity fact table the granularity per ticket no so every row represents details about flights 
for every ticket no.

in frequent flyer fact table the granularity per passenger,so every row represents details about flights
 each frequent flyer had.

in reservation fact table the granularity per every reservation ,so every row represents details about
 all flights reservations.

in interaction fact tble the granularity per every interaction, so very row represents details about 
 all customer interactions.
